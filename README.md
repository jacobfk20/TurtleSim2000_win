# TurtleSim2000 Monogame Port
This is a port of my old XNA/C# build of TurtleSim2000 to the monogame framework. (almost the same as XNA) I'm still
working out the kinks to get it running just the same as it does in XNA.

# Compiling:
Although all the source code is here, the art assets and other resources are not.  I'll be hosting those somewhere else soon
when I get the time to document the code better.  for now you will only need Monogame.  The game should compile just fine
with that and the assets.
